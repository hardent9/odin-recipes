        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious an easy to make layered casserole dish!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 large bell pepper, diced (approx. 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, mixed</li>
            <li>1 28-ounce can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste (1/2 a 6-ounce can)</li>
            <li>1 14 ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano (or 2 teaspoons dried)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley, packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>Pinch garlic powder or garlic salt, to taste</li>
            <li>About 1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar, to taste</li>
            <li>Sugar to taste, not more than 1/4 cup</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin heating pasta water to boil:</li>
            <p>Put a large pot of salted water on high heat; prepare the sauce while the water is heating up.</p>
            <li>Brown the ground beef:</li>
            <p>In a large pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add ground beef and cook until lightly brown all over, then remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain all but a tablespoon of the residual fat.</p>
            <li>Cook onion, garlic, and bell pepper:</li>
            <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onion to the pan, then cook until the onions and pepper soften (about 4-5 minutes). Add garlic and cook about half a minute more or until the garlic is very fragrant.</p>
            <p>Return the ground beef to the pan and stir, reducing heat to low. Cook for about 5 more minutes to combine flavours.</p>
            <li>Add liquids to make the sauce:</li>
            <p>Transfer the beef and vegetables to a medium pot, then add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, parsley, oregano, and Italian seasoning. Sprinkle garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.</p>
            <p>Add red or white wine vinegar, then stir in sugar, not more than a tablespoon at a time, tasting between additions. Add salt to taste, but recall that you will add salty parmesan cheese later.</p>
            <p>Bring the mixture to a simmering boil, then reduce to low heat, keeping it at a low simmer. Cook for about 15-45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom as you stir, ensuring nothing sticks long enough to burn. Remove from heat when satisfied.</p>
            <li>Boil and drain lasagna noodles:</li>
            <p>This step may be started early if you like, whenever the water is boiling. The noodles can even be cooked in advance, if you prefer. Add dry lasagna noodles to boiling water, then cook them al dente according to package directions.</p>
            <p>Stir the water frequently to avoid sticking and burning. The water should be at a rolling boil throughout the process, helping to keep the noodles from sticking.</p>
            <p>When the noodles are al dente, drain them in a colander and rinse them with cold water. Separate any noodles that may stick together.</p>
            <p>Spread a bit of olive oil on a large baking sheet, then lay out and flip the noodles, coating all sides. This will prevent sticking.</p>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F</li>
            <p>This step may be started earlier, depending on how long your oven takes to heat up.</p>
            <li>Assemble lasagna:</li>
            <p>Ladle about a cup of sauce mix into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, spreading evenly. Arrange a layer of noodles lengthwise over the sauce (probably 3 long noodles; the edges may or may not overlap). Ladle about a third of the remaining sauce on top of the noodles.</p>
            <p>Cover the sauce with an even layer of about 1/3 of the grated mozzarella and add about 1/2 the ricotta in dollops spaced about 2 inches apart. Sprinkle half of the grated parmesan evenly on top.</p>
            <p>Apply the second layer of noodles and top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining mozzarella, then the rest of the ricotta cheese in the same manner as before. Sprinkle the remaining parmesan on top.</p>
            <p>Add the final layer of noodles, then top with the remaining sauce, then the remaining mozzarella.</p>
            <li>Once oven is heated, bake:</li>
            <p>Cover the lasagna dish with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesnt touch the top of the assembled lasagna. Bake for 45 minutes at 375&deg;F. If a crispier top and edges are desired, remove the foil for the last 5-10 minutes.</p>
            <li>Cool and serve:</li>
            <p>Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 minutes to allow it to set somewhat before serving.</p>
            <p>Store with aluminum foil on top (or, at very least, a layer of plastic wrap), keeping it from squashing against the lasagna. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days, and may be reheated in a microwave, toaster oven, or oven.</p>
