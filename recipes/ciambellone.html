        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A tender and lightly lemony Italian bundt cake that takes only an hour!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><strong>TIP</strong>: if possible, use mass measurements rather than volume.</p>
            <li>3/4 cup (170g) room temperature unsalted butter, plus a little extra to grease the pan</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1-1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 lemons finely grated; about 1 tablespoon of their zest, lightly packed</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>5 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (28g) corn or potato starch</li>
            <li>2-3/4 cups (330g) all-purpose flour, plus a little extra to prep the pan</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (180mL) milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar for dusting, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F</li>
            <li>Prepare the pan:</li>
            <p>Liberally grease a bundt pan with butter, coating all ridges well. Dust with flour thoroughly and tap out all excess.</p>
            <li>Beat a butter and sugar mixture:</li>
            <p>With a hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, oil, sugar, zest, and salt on medium speed. Stop when the mixture is pale, light, and fluffy. This should take about 4 minutes with a mechanical mixer.</p>
            <li>Add the eggs:</li>
            <p>One at a time, add the eggs, beating well with each addition for about 1 minute. Pause occasionally to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl with a spatula.</p>
            <li>Alternate adding dry ingredients and milk:</li>
            <p>Add the starch and half of the flour, then beat on low speed until combined. Pour in the milk and vanilla extract and mix until incorporated.</p>
            <p>Add the remaining flour and the baking powder. Switch to a spatula and fold in these ingredients until the batter is smooth and no flour lumps remain. The batter should be thick.</p>
            <li>Once oven is heated, bake:</li>
            <p>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, using the spatula to spread the batter into an even layer and smooth the top. Bake at 350&deg;F until the cake is a golden brown and a thin skewer may be inserted to the center comes out clean; approximately 45 minutes.</p>
            <li>Cool and serve:</li>
            <p>Set the pan on a wire rack and allow it to cool for 15 minutes. Gently loosen the edges of the cake with a small spatula or butter knife, then place the wire rack upside down on the cake pan. Flip the whole assembly so that the cake drops on to the rack, then carefully remove the pan. Allow the cake to cool completely.</p>
            <p>Place the cake on a large plate or platter and dust it with as much powdered sugar as you prefer.</p>
            <p>Store leftovers covered; they should keep for up to 4 days.</p>
        </ol>
